# Decision_Tree_classifier
The purpose of this project is to explore the decision tree classifier. This notebook deals with understanding  the working principle of the decision tree.

# Exploring Decision Tree Algorithm
For the given 'Iris' dataset (Iris dataset is selected here because we are now familiar with it), create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

This notebooks deals with understanding the working of decision trees.
